							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h4>Top Advertising Challenges Today</h4>
									<p>Advertising used to be simple; there was a time when putting up a sign outside the shop or distributing flyers all around the town were enough. This was perfectly fine during the 17th century. Fast forward to the present, the world is now drifting in the sea of commercial clutter. It takes a great deal of time, planning, and effort in order to face the top advertising problems of today: </p>
							
							<h4>Budget limits</h4>
									<p>Unless you’re a multinational company or a global brand, almost every business out there goes by on a limited budget, especially for advertising. Entrepreneurs try to squeeze their pockets as much as they can, in hopes that customers will take notice. However, it requires finding the right techniques, audience, and platform to handle the limited resources effectively. Those who begin with very ambitious goals may risk their money too much, while those who are very cautious may spend very little, thus ending up with their efforts unnoticed.[1] Setting a limit is necessary, but it should be done with realistic goals. The allocation should be just enough for your business to test its market first, because of the uncertainties that lie ahead. </p>
							
							<h4>Compelling content</h4>
								<p>With the abundance of advertisements all over place, how would you make your business stand out? The challenge begins in crafting the right message and transforming it into something that looks or sounds new. To give your business a voice, you need to identify your audience first. What would they like to hear? Would this type of message spark their interest? Do they need to know about this? Compelling content - this is the main challenge for every advertiser out there, and what every business owner hopes to have in his advertisement. Crafting the perfect sales pitch is not easy, as most people are already aware of those overused marketing bait lines such as “buy now before it’s too late”, “wait there’s more”, or “for a limited time only”. Nowadays, people look around, research, and rationalize before making a purchase. That is why in creating the ideal content, there should be sincere, detailed solutions that will answer the needs of the target customers.[2] </p>
							
							<h4>Choosing the right method</h4>
								<p>There is no perfect formula for advertising because the methods depend on the type of audience that you have. Choosing the suitable advertising technique for your business will involve a series of tests until you find the right one. It can be tricky, but you need to decide whether you’re going to place your ads on the internet, radio, print, outdoor, or TV. Sometimes it could be a combination of two or three methods that brings in the most number of customers for you. For local businesses, you may combine traditional with digital advertising method. An example would be using a car magnet which includes the name of your website. Hence, people would find your business online through your offline advertisement. </p>									
							
							<h4>Measuring effectiveness</h4>
								<p>Probably, one of the hardest parts of advertising is identifying the effectiveness of the campaign. This becomes more difficult if the business is running different advertisements at the same time. The worse thing could be running the ad without verifying if it actually gets the job done. Money could be wasted on a tiny newspaper ad space that may be enough to pay for an outdoor poster that everyone could see. It could also be a social media ad that does not generate enough clicks. To check if the advertisement is working, set a time frame for a particular ad and observe if it affects your sales.[3] </p>
							
							<h4>Rising through the competition</h4>
								<p>With limited resources, it can be tough to keep up with the competition. In fact, to get noticed, you do not have to blend yourself in. Analyze the factors which distinguish your business from the big companies, and know that you can offer a more personalized service. For small business owners, it pays to work with sincerity. An honest, reliable, and commendable service is a good way to set your business apart from the competition. Give your customers a great buying experience, and do not be afraid to ask for recommendations because this is the best form of advertising that you could ever have.[4] </p>
