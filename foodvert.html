							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/rethink.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h4>Foodvert®</h4>
									<p>The typical advertising just isnt good enough any longer. Advertising printed on flyers, newspapers, magazines are either dominated by the largest companies due to their dominance in the market, or they are being thrown into the trash before they see daylight. Foodvert® is a new brand and trend we as re:magine media have started in UAE after successful results in Scandinavia; Norway and Finland being our initial start point. </p>
							
							<h4>Guaranteed 100% efficiency in each print item</h4>
									<p>This really is something that almost no one can promise their clients. Simply because they print millions of flyers or advertise in magazines that cost you the shirt off. Even online ads that have been popular over the last two decades have diminished as we cant really control how many people that see our ads. These channels are often dominated by the major players, are very expensive pay per click, or simply are being fought against thanks to readily available extensions or ad blocking software that are being used more and more. <a href="blogdigitalchallenges.html">Read our article about this subject here</a> </p>
							
							<h4>A secret until its revealed</h4>
									<p>As with our professional approach to any kind of business practices, we save our business information to a personal correspondence with our team. We will therefore only disclose this much of our business until we meet. Get in touch with us to get full preview of our new concept. </p>
